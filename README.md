This is Week 6 of Makers, and we are working on our first group project, lasting for 5 days.

# Makers bnb

Makers bnb allows users to list properties and book properties that are listed

## MVP

There are many avenues of detail we could go down on this project, so initially we decided on certain key points which we thought were the most important aspects to have a functioning application.

* Users can sign-up

Once logged in a user can...
* Other listings page
  * View all listings
* Own listings page
  * Add a listing

## Next iteration
* Signed-up users can log in

* Other listings page
  * Book a listing

* Own listings page
  * Can view their own listings
  * Get confirmation of a booking

## User Stories
